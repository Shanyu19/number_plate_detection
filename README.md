# ðŸš— number_plate_detection

This project is a basic implementation of image preprocessing techniques using MATLAB, aimed at preparing vehicle images for potential license plate recognition. It demonstrates how to load, resize, and display images using MATLAB functions. The script is modular and can be extended for further tasks such as character segmentation or OCR-based license plate detection.

## ðŸ“‚ Files & Resources Used

- **car_image6.jpg** â€“ Input image of a car used for processing.
- **main.m** â€“ The primary MATLAB script that contains all the code for:
  - Loading the image
  - Resizing the image
  - Displaying intermediate results

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Read and display car images using `imread` and `imshow`
- âœ… Resize image to a standardized height while preserving aspect ratio
- âœ… Clean, beginner-friendly MATLAB code structure
- âœ… Ready for future extensions like:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Edge detection
  - Plate region extraction
  - OCR-based recognition

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **MATLAB R2020a+**
- **Image Processing Toolbox** (optional for advanced steps)
